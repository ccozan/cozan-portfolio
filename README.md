## Cloud Journey
I discovered cloud computing two years ago; I have been intrigued ever since. I am currently working on my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification!

- Successfully launched Amazon Linux 2 instance to send files to Amazon CloudWatch.
- Effectively created Amazon CloudWatch alarms and notifications to alert me to a specified amount of login failures on the EC2 instances.
- Lastly, I created a CloudWatch alarm and notification to monitor outgoing traffic through a NAT gateway.
